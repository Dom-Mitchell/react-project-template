## Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create a basic webpage to act as a template for all future html/react projects.

The above is a screen capture of the template that I created.

![image of My Favicon](././src/icons/current/dai5.svg)

The above is a custom favicon that I made for the template, to be used in all future html/react projects.
